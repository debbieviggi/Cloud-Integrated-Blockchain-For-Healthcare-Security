The healthcare industry is rapidly transforming with the integration of electronic healthcare applications (e- Healthcare), such as Electronic Health Records (EHR), which contain patient data. The healthcare industry faces significant challenges regarding the security and privacy of patient data with increasing incidents of data breached and unauthorized access to sensitive information. However, this data digitizational brings challenges related to data privacy and security, especially concerning sensitive patent information.Traditional healthcare systems often lack robust encryption mechanisms, making them vulnerable, to data breaches and unauthorized access. To address this, decentralized Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks offer localized data processing, avoiding long-distance delays.
