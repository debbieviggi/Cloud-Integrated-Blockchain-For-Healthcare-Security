Cloud-Integrated Blockchain for Healthcare Security

A secure and scalable healthcare data management system that integrates Blockchain technology with Cloud computing to ensure data integrity, privacy, and controlled access to sensitive medical records.

Project Overview

Healthcare data is highly sensitive and requires strong security, transparency, and trust. This project leverages Blockchain to provide tamper-proof record storage while using Cloud infrastructure for scalability and availability.

The system enables secure storage, access, and sharing of patient medical records among authorized entities such as doctors, hospitals, and patients.

Objectives

Ensure data integrity and immutability using Blockchain

Enable secure cloud-based storage for large healthcare records

Prevent unauthorized access and data tampering

Provide transparent and auditable access logs

Improve trust between healthcare stakeholders

Technologies Used

Blockchain (Ethereum / Hyperledger / Custom Blockchain)

Smart Contracts

Cloud Platform

Backend: Python

Database: IPFS

Frontend: HTML, CSS

Security: Cryptography, Hashing, Digital Signatures

System Architecture

Patient data is uploaded to Cloud Storage

A hash of the data is generated

The hash is stored on the Blockchain

Smart contracts manage access control

Only authorized users can view or modify records
